# Create PRD

Turns a rough ask into one lean PRD: a single problem statement, goals, user stories with acceptance, scope, and open questions. Nothing else.

**Entry.** Start from any ask, issue, or notes the Human points to. There is no required prior artifact — a plain description of the problem is enough to begin grilling it.

## Workflow

The session skill list is the list of skills the runtime provided for this session. A folder on disk does not count. A name remembered from an earlier summary does not count.

### 1. Grill the problem

When the session skill list includes `grilling`, run `grilling` on the problem before drafting, with no cap on the number of questions. Start the tree from who hurts, what the pain is, why now, and what evidence backs it, and keep going until there is one problem: one set of users and one pain.

If the grilling surfaces a second problem, split it into its own PRD or park it under Open questions — do not fold two problems into one draft.

Stop grilling only when you can state the problem in one sentence and the Human confirms it. Anything still unanswered goes under Open questions rather than being invented.

When `grilling` is absent from the session skill list, draft from the ask with the term check and the template. The PRD file and the reply include `grilling did not run`. Do not interview in place of grilling. Do not name an install command for `grilling`.

### 2. Term challenge

Check the key terms the problem statement introduces against the local docs and any recorded architecture decisions — search first before asking or guessing. Reuse a name that already exists rather than coining a new one. When a term genuinely has no existing name, record it at its first use in the PRD instead of writing a separate glossary.

### 3. Draft

Write the PRD from `references/prd-template.md` to `docs/prds/<slug>/<slug>-prd.md`, with `status: draft`. Fill every section; leave nothing as the template's placeholder text. Give each goal an observable success signal. Give each `US-<n>` story a goal it traces to and `AC-<n>.<m>` acceptance in Given / When / Then for its happy path and at least one edge or error case. Give each open question an owner, or write "None".

### 4. Approve

Revise the draft in place until the Human approves it, then change `status` from `draft` to `stable`. Only the Human's explicit word moves the status — a quiet absence of objection is not approval.

The approved PRD becomes `code-spec`'s input. Approval locks the requirements; it does not authorize writing code. At pre-merge closure, `code-pr` moves the whole PRD folder to `docs/prds/archived/<slug>/` with `status: deprecated`; that move is not this skill's job.

### 5. ADR offer

If the PRD settles a decision that should outlive this one change — a durable choice about architecture, a dependency, or a convention — and the session skill list includes `adr`, offer to record it with the `adr` skill. When `adr` is absent from the session skill list, write no decision record and name `adr` in the reply. The PRD itself states requirements; it is not the decision record.

## Refuses

- Scoring or classifying how complicated the problem is before drafting.
- A field naming who or what carries out the resulting work.
- Handing the PRD to an external tracker, or writing steps shaped like its cards.
- Implementation detail — how the code will be built belongs in `code-spec`, not here.
- Emitting the stories or their acceptance as separate files instead of PRD sections.

## Anti-patterns

- Drafting before the problem statement is confirmed while `grilling` is on the session skill list, or before a surfaced second problem is split out.
- Reusing a borrowed term without checking it against local docs first.
- Setting `status: stable` without the Human's explicit approval.
- Treating an approved PRD as permission to start writing code.
- Padding a user story with a persona-only acceptance line that never says Given/When/Then.
