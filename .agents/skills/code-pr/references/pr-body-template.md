# Pull request body template

Normative body for `code-pr`; its hard gates govern the title, the lean
fill, and the evidence. Keep and fill every section below — an empty
placeholder is not a valid fill.

**Checkbox reset:** write every checkbox as `[ ]` first, then tick only
those this session's evidence supports. Never copy ticks forward from a
prior body. Pre-merge closure stays unchecked unless it already ran on this
branch.

## Scenario examples (approved shape)

### Skills or routing change

**Title:** `feat(skills): add a pull-request skill`

Summary Overview states the outcome; Changes Made names outcomes, not a
file inventory; Verification names the gate command actually run; Risk is
often Medium when a load-path or routing surface changes.

### Small, scoped fix

**Title:** `fix(validate): reject an empty description on a draft`

Tight What/Why/How; Changes Made names the gate plus its fixture; Risk Low;
Review focus on not widening an unrelated rule.

### Docs-only change, mid-initiative

**Title:** `docs(specs): record an intake step`

Task/Ticket points at the relevant spec or plan path. Verification may be
N/A with a reason, or name a docs-only check. Pre-merge closure boxes stay
**unchecked** — implementation hasn't shipped yet. Risk Low.
