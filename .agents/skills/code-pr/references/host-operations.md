# Host operations

The nine operations below are the only git-host actions any ship skill performs.
Read `gitHost` from `.wolven-harness.json` (`gh` = GitHub, `bit` = Bitbucket
Cloud) and use the matching half of the table. When `.wolven-harness.json`
has no `gitHost`, the host action does not happen, the reply names `setup`,
and the skill does not assume GitHub. For each operation, try the
MCP tool for that host first; if the MCP tool is absent or the call fails,
fall back to the `gh` command or the Bitbucket REST route in the same row
without asking. Never merge, enable auto-merge, or read merge settings —
merging is never a step here.

Take credentials only from an already-connected MCP session, or from an
environment variable named below — never from a value typed into a prompt,
and never write a credential to the repo. GitHub: the MCP session, or
`GH_TOKEN` (the `gh` CLI also honors its own logged-in `gh auth` session).
Bitbucket: the MCP session, or the pair `BITBUCKET_EMAIL` and
`BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN` for the REST fallback. Bitbucket REST routes below are relative to `https://api.bitbucket.org`, sent with HTTP basic auth from that pair.

| Operation | GitHub MCP | gh fallback | GitHub doc | Rovo MCP (Bitbucket) | Bitbucket REST | Bitbucket doc |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| push branch | none — no MCP tool pushes a local branch to either host | `git push` (plain git, not GitHub-specific) | https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server | none — no MCP tool pushes a local branch to either host | `git push` (plain git, not Bitbucket-specific) | https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/interacting-with-bitbucket-via-mcp/ |

| list unresolved threads | `pull_request_read` (`method: get_review_comments`) | `gh api graphql` (query `reviewThreads`, filter on `isResolved: false`) | https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_api | none — no tool filters by resolution state; `getPullRequestComments` returns comments only | `GET /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pullrequests/{pull_request_id}/comments` (entries with no `resolution` field) | https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-pullrequests/ |

| resolve a thread | `pull_request_review_write` (`method: resolve_thread`) | `gh api graphql` (`resolveReviewThread` mutation) | https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_api | none — no tool marks a comment resolved | `POST /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pullrequests/{pull_request_id}/comments/{comment_id}/resolve` | https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-pullrequests/ |

| read a failing log | `get_job_logs` (`failed_only: true`) | `gh run view --log-failed` | https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_run_view | none — `analyzePipelineStepFailure` diagnoses a failure but returns no raw log text | `GET /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pipelines/{pipeline_uuid}/steps/{step_uuid}/log` | https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-pipelines/ |
