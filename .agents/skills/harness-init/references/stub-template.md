# Stub Template

Renders the ask-only stub step 5 writes for one skill the Human picked — a
`SKILL.md` plus an `agents/openai.yaml`, both held here verbatim with
placeholders. `description` says what the skill does, in third person,
then when to use it. The body cites the evidence, stamps the tool version, and asks the Human to
fill each step up to its done line.

## Never overwrite

An existing skill folder is never overwritten. Before writing, check
`.agents/skills/<name>/` for a match; if it already exists, ask the Human
for another name or skip that suggestion instead. A half-written skill
therefore never lands on top of one that already works — and never fires
on its own either: `disable-model-invocation: true` in `SKILL.md` plus
`allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml` hold until the
Human removes them.

## Fill

Replace angle-bracket placeholders from discovery. The four steps stay
prompts for the Human — this write records evidence and stops short of
authoring the tool's workflow. Cited evidence, Local decision, and
Length say how each remaining line is filled.

## Files

`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: <name>
description: "<What the skill does, in third person>. Use when <trigger>"
metadata:
  wolven-harness: stub
disable-model-invocation: true
---

# <name>

Ask-only: an explicit ask for `<name>` is the only run.
`disable-model-invocation: true` stays until the Human removes it. While
any step below is still a prompt, the run stops after Cited evidence and
Local decision. The workflow for <tool-or-field> is step 3, and step 3
stays a prompt until the Human fills it.

## Cited evidence

Cite each source that led to this stub. An external skill is a name and
a location; its text stays in its own file.

- Decided tool: <tool-or-field>
- Repo file: <path>
- External skill: <skill-name and location, or none>
- Generated against: <tool-or-field> <version, or no version recorded>

## Local decision

When a cited skill conflicts with a stable ADR or an existing workflow
in this repo, record the conflict here and follow the local decision.
The conflicting step stays out of this skill.

- Conflict: <none, or the stable ADR or existing workflow and the cited step that differs>
- Follow: <the local decision>

Done when: Conflict is `none`, or it names the stable ADR or existing
workflow and the cited step that differs, and Follow names the local
decision whenever Conflict names one.

## Steps

### 1. Trigger

Ask the Human what this skill does and when an agent should reach for
it. Write both into `description`: what it does, in third person, then
`Use when …` with one distinct situation per branch.

Done when: `description` opens with what the skill does, in third
person, its `Use when` clause follows, and every branch is a situation
the Human stated in this step.

### 2. Conventions

Ask the Human what they decided for <tool-or-field> — naming, layout, and
the rules they already follow. Write each decision as its own bullet.

Done when: every bullet is a decision the Human stated, and a reader can
point at the Human's answer for each one.

### 3. Workflow

Ask the Human for the ordered steps this skill runs for <tool-or-field>.
Write them here, each ending with its own `Done when:` line. A cited step
that Local decision records as a conflict stays out.

Done when: every step ends with a `Done when:` line whose result a later
run can observe — a command's exit code, a file's contents, or a diff —
and each step is one the Human stated.

### 4. Verify

Ask the Human for the command or the file read that shows the skill did
its job. Write that command or path here.

Done when: the command or the path is written below, and running it or
reading it differs when the job is done from when it is not.

## Length

Keep this file under 500 lines. When only one branch of a step needs
the detail, put it in `references/<slug>.md` in this skill folder — one
level down — and link it from that step.
```

`.agents/skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml`:

```yaml
interface:
  display_name: "<name>"
  short_description: "<What the skill does, in third person>. Use when <trigger>"
policy:
  allow_implicit_invocation: false
```

## Until it's defined

`harness:validate` warns `skill-stub-open` for each stub's `SKILL.md`,
once per file, for as long as its `metadata` still carries
`wolven-harness: stub`. Defining a stub means filling each headed step
until its `Done when` holds, then removing that marker — and, only if
the Human wants the skill model-invocable, also removing
`disable-model-invocation: true` and the `agents/openai.yaml` file. Short
of that, the warning stays and the skill stays ask-only.

## Commit

Every stub this step writes lands in the setup phase's single commit
offer, together with everything else steps 2 through 6 write — never a
commit per stub, and never a commit per file inside one.

## Hand-back

Hand back to the Human: define each stub, then remove the marker.
