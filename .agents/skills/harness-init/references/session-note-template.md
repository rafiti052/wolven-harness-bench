# Session Note Template

The session note is the run's own record — created before anything else is
written, and the one file every phase adds to.

## Path

The note lives at
`docs/notes/harness-init-<yyyy-mm-dd>/harness-init-<yyyy-mm-dd>-note.md` —
one slug folder, dated the day the run started, holding one main doc. A
second run on the same day does not collide with the first: it uses
`harness-init-<yyyy-mm-dd>-2` as the slug, for both the folder and the file
— `docs/notes/harness-init-<yyyy-mm-dd>-2/harness-init-<yyyy-mm-dd>-2-note.md`
— fitting the same `docs/<folder>/<slug>/<slug>-<type>.md` layout every
other note in this profile uses.

## Template

Hold this note verbatim when creating it, filling each placeholder from
what the run actually did:

```markdown
---
type: note
title: <title>
description: <one-sentence description of what this run did>
status: <status>
---

# <title>

## Entry integration

<the mode question as asked, the mode recommended and why, and the Human's answer — plus any checks step 0 raised>

## ADR migration

<one row per migrated ADR in the table below — or "skipped — no legacy ADRs" when step 1 never ran, with the table left out>

| Number | Title | Legacy status | Mapped status | Evidence | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <number> | <title of the ADR> | <legacy status as the repo wrote it> | <mapped status> | <where the status and any still-applies language came from> | <"table" for a direct mapping, or the Human's answer> |

<each claim repointed, reworded, or left as is during the claim loop and the meaning check, with the Human's answer>

### Meaning check

<grouped by ADR number, in the bare-number form below: each citing `file:line` with `ok` or `mismatch → the Human's answer`. Skipped only when step 1 was skipped.>

## Discovery

<the context list, the lifecycle note, and the decided-tools list step 2 produced>

## Research

<the sources cited for each finding, or "repo-only" with the reason the web was skipped or unavailable>

## Suggestions

<the two to four skills suggested, and which of them the Human picked>

## Stubs

<the stubs written for the Human's picks>

## Harness score

<the level and score before and after, each dimension question with the Human's answer, and every check dropped in `.harness-score.json` with its reason>

## Validate wiring

<the wiring question as asked, the option recommended and why, the Human's answer (CI job, chained script, or local only), and what was written — or "nothing written"; or "deferred — see Deferred / skipped steps" when the lean path deferred the wiring question>

## Deferred / skipped steps

**Mode:** <lean or full>

**Immediate goal:** <the goal the Human stated or answered, in their words, or "none stated" — on the lean path only; "n/a — full path" otherwise>

<one row per lean-path deferral (the four deferrable items only), or "none" when the full path ran>

| Step | Name | Reason | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <number> | <step name> | <why this step was deferred or skipped> | <what still needs doing later> |

## Next steps for the Human

<what the Human still has to define in each stub, and anything else left open>
```

Every section heading above stays in the note even when its step was
skipped — a skipped step fills its section with why, rather than leaving
the heading empty or dropping it, so the note always shows the full shape
of the run. **Deferred / skipped steps** holds the lean section: the mode, the
immediate goal, and the deferral list (step number, name, reason, remaining
work); fill the deferral list with `none` when nothing was deferred. It is
filled as step 0 creates the note, since the lean goal and deferrals are
agreed before step 0.

## Naming ADRs in the note

The note sits under `docs/notes/`, and `harness:validate` checks every ADR
reference there as a claim, code spans and file paths included: a claim to
a `draft` or `deprecated` ADR fails. So the note names an ADR only by its
bare number and title ("007, Cache with Memcached"), never in the claim
forms — the `ADR-NNN` token or its `adr-NNN-<slug>` filename — even in the
legacy-status and evidence columns. Otherwise the note's own record of a
deprecation would fail the check it documents.

## Lifecycle

- **Created.** The note is created with `status: draft` at the very start
  of step 0, before anything else in the run is written.
- **Grows with the run.** Each phase — entry, migration, setup — adds its
  own section (or sections) to the note before that phase's commit offer,
  so every phase commit carries its own part of the note alongside
  whatever else that phase wrote. No section waits until hand-back to be
  filled in.
- **Closes.** Step 6 fills in whatever sections are still open and sets
  `status: stable` at hand-back.
- **Resuming.** A `draft` note left by an interrupted run is the run's own
  state, not a leftover to clean up: the next run reads it and keeps
  filling it in, rather than starting a second note over it.

## Anti-patterns

- Dropping a section heading for a step that was skipped instead of
  saying so.
- Leaving every section unfilled until hand-back, instead of adding each
  phase's part before that phase's commit offer.
- Starting a new note over a `draft` note left by an interrupted run.
- Naming an ADR in the note by its claim token or filename instead of its
  bare number and title.
- Omitting a lean-path deferral from **Deferred / skipped steps** after the
  Human agreed to skip it.
