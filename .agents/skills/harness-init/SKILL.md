# Harness Init

One guided session that takes a repo from a fresh `wolven-harness setup` (or a
bare `.agents/skills/` tree) to a working setup: the entry file folded into
`AGENTS.md`, any legacy ADRs migrated into `docs/adrs/`, the repo understood,
a short list of suggested skills stubbed out, the harness scored, and a
session note recording what happened. The Human steers every write.

**Consult:** `adr`, `research`, `code-commit` (when installed), `qmd`, `grilling`.

## Hard gates

These rules hold across every step below.

1. **`harness:validate` drives what comes next.** Read its output before
   deciding the next move — never guess at a status, a warning, or an exit
   code it would have reported.
2. **One question at a time.** An ambiguity — an entry mode, an ADR status,
   a successor, anything the repo or the Human hasn't settled — becomes a
   single question to the Human, the recommended option listed first (see
   `grilling`).
3. **Never invent.** No status, successor ADR, entry mode, or decision is
   assumed on the agent's own judgment; each one comes from what the Human
   answers or what `harness:validate` reports. A claim that starts failing
   after migration is expected input to work through with the Human, not a
   defect to paper over.
4. **No consumer names.** This skill names no specific consumer repository
   and carries no steps special-cased for one. The rules hold for any repo it
   meets; when a repo presents something they don't cover, that is a question
   for the Human, not a new rule.

## Session note

`references/session-note-template.md` renders the record of this run at
`docs/notes/harness-init-<yyyy-mm-dd>/harness-init-<yyyy-mm-dd>-note.md`
(a second run on the same day adds `-2`). It is created `draft` at the start
of step 0. Each phase below adds its section to the note before that
phase's commit offer, so every phase commit carries its part of the note,
and the note turns `stable` at hand-back in step 6. A `draft` note left by
an interrupted run is where the next run resumes from — never start a
second note over it.

## Phased commits

The run has three writing phases:

| Phase | Steps |
|-------|-------|
| Entry | 0 |
| Migration | 1 |
| Setup | 2–6 |

At the end of each phase, once `harness:validate` exits 0 — `0 legacy-warn`
as well, for the migration phase — offer one commit of that phase's paths
through `code-commit`, and commit only on the Human's yes. When `code-commit`
is not installed (no `.agents/skills/code-commit/`), ask the Human before each
phase's commit and make it with plain `git commit` of that phase's paths, again
only on their yes. Never a single commit at the end of the whole run, and
never a commit per file, ADR, claim, or stub. A declined commit leaves that
phase uncommitted, and the next phase's offer covers only its own paths —
the two never merge into one.

Every writing step also shows the Human the diff before writing, runs
`harness:validate` right after it writes, and waits for the Human's choice
before moving on.

## Re-run skips

A re-run does not redo what an earlier run already finished:

- Step 0 is skipped when `WOLVEN.md` is already gone, or `AGENTS.md`
  already mentions it.
- An `AGENTS.md` that already holds the harness section was integrated by
  an earlier run, even when `setup` has since brought `WOLVEN.md` back:
  never fold it a second time; show the diff, ask whether to refresh the
  section, then delete `WOLVEN.md` (see "Already integrated" in
  [references/entry-modes.md](references/entry-modes.md)).
- Step 1 is skipped when there are no legacy-ADR warnings left.
- A `draft` session note from an interrupted run is resumed, not replaced,
  with the mode, immediate goal and deferrals it already records.

## Lean path

The lean decision comes after the re-run checks above. When a `stable`
harness-init note already exists, lean does not apply and the re-run skips
run as on the full path. Otherwise, when a `draft` note records the lean
mode or the tree shows thin evidence, load
[references/lean-path.md](references/lean-path.md) and follow it before step 0.

## Workflow

### 0. Entry integration

Fold the entry file into `AGENTS.md` in one of three modes — full, light,
or mention-only. Put the mode to the Human as one question, the recommended
mode first with the reason and the other two as options; never pick it
silently. This step also checks for existing `AGENTS.md` content, an
overlapping router or rule, a `CLAUDE.md` that should import `AGENTS.md`,
any harness path an ignore rule keeps from other clones (proposing
re-include rules), and existing content in the five doc folders the
writing profile governs. See
[references/entry-modes.md](references/entry-modes.md).

### 1. Legacy ADR migration (optional)

Offered only when `harness:validate` reports `legacy-adr`. Turns each
legacy ADR into a profile ADR under `docs/adrs/` — keeping its number,
moving it, prepending frontmatter, mapping its status (asking when part
of a superseded ADR still applies, and searching for the tokens tests pin
first) — and closes the step by recomputing links, working every failing
claim with the Human, and checking that each claim to a touched ADR names
the right decision, until `harness:validate` exits 0 with `0 legacy-warn`. See
[references/adr-migration.md](references/adr-migration.md).

### 2. Discovery

Read what the repo already shows — manifests, lockfiles, README, `AGENTS.md`, CI
config, `docs/adrs/`, installed skills, top-level layout — and ask the
Human only for what files can't show: lifecycle stage and decisions not yet
visible in code. Produces a context list, a lifecycle note, and a
decided-tools list. See [references/discovery.md](references/discovery.md).

### 3. Research

Search the repo and `qmd` first. Web research is optional, runs only on
the Human's yes, is capped at five primary-source fetches, and covers
decided tools only, with every finding cited in the session note; offer
`research` for depth on one tool. Continue repo-only, and say so in the
note, when the web is unavailable. See
[references/discovery.md](references/discovery.md).

### 4. Suggest 2–4 skills

Suggest two to four architectural skills, each named for a decided tool or
field and citing the discovery evidence, never duplicating an installed
skill. Say so, rather than padding, if the evidence supports fewer than
two. The Human picks any subset. See
[references/discovery.md](references/discovery.md).

### 5. Write stubs

Render each skill the Human picked by filling the placeholders in
[references/stub-template.md](references/stub-template.md). That file is
the pattern: a trigger `description`, ask-only frontmatter, cited
evidence with a generated-against stamp, and headed prompts, each step
ending on a checkable done. The write is done when both rendered files
exist, no existing skill folder was overwritten, and `harness:validate`
warns `skill-stub-open` once for that `SKILL.md`.

### 6. Score, session note and hand-back

First run `harness:score` and record the level and score. For each dimension
with a failing check, ask one question: keep its checks as gaps to build
later, or drop them in `.harness-score.json`. Never build a check in this run,
and never drop one without the Human's yes. Score again and record the level,
the score and every drop. See
[references/harness-score.md](references/harness-score.md).

Then put one question to the Human: how should `harness:validate` be wired —
(a) as a CI job on pull requests, (b) chained into the repo's existing
`validate` or `test` script, or (c) local only? Detect the CI config and the
existing scripts first, frame the options with that evidence, and list the
recommended option first. Nothing is written without the Human's yes. See
[references/validate-wiring.md](references/validate-wiring.md).

Then add the note's final sections, set it `stable`, and hand the run back to
the Human with what was done and what is left for them to define. See
[references/session-note-template.md](references/session-note-template.md).

The run ends at hand-back. Defining stubs or building score gaps is a
separate change on its own branch, not a commit on the harness-init branch.
If the Human asks for it in the same session, say so and stop.

## Anti-patterns

- Guessing at an ambiguous status, mode, or successor instead of asking the
  Human.
- Special-casing a known repo instead of applying these rules and asking
  the Human.
- One commit at the end of the run, or a commit per file, ADR, claim, or
  stub.
- Writing before showing the diff, or before the Human has chosen.
- Starting a new session note over a `draft` note left by an interrupted
  run.
- Treating a validate failure after migration as this skill's defect
  instead of expected input to work through with the Human.
- Silently skipping a lean-path step without naming it, why, and remaining
  work before proceeding.
- Deferring skill proposals (step 4) on the lean path.
